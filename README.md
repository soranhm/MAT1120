# MAT1120
MAT1120 â€“ Linear Algebra

## Course content
MAT1120 gives a thorough introduction to linear algebra with emphasis on vector spaces, linear maps, spectral theory, orthogonality and applications of this theory. MATLAB is used for illustrations and for solving numerically various problems. MAT1120 is based on, and is a natural continuation of, MAT1110, and the course is a building block for a number of advanced mathematical courses.
